# Digital Signature SDK

HTTP message signatures provide a mechanism for end-to-end authenticity and integrity for components of an HTTP message.

This NodeJS SDK is designed to simplify the process of generating digital signature headers and also provides a method to validate the digital signature headers.

## Digital Signatures for Public API Calls

Due to regulatory requirements emanating from SCA for our European/UK sellers, we are requiring our developers to add a digital signature for every HTTP call that is made on behalf of a EU/UK seller to certain APIs.

This SDK is generic and the signature scheme is compliant with these upcoming IETF standards (currently not yet RFCs).

* [draft-ietf-httpbis-message-signatures-13](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-httpbis-message-signatures-13.html)
* [draft-ietf-httpbis-digest-headers-10](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-httpbis-digest-headers-10.html)

## Features

This SDK is intended to generate required message signature headers, as per the above IEFT standards, and also provides a way to verfiy signature headers. There is also an example NodeJS service included with the SDK.

This SDK incorporates

* Generation of the following HTTP message signature headers:
  * **Content-Digest**: This header includes a SHA-256 digest over the HTTP payload (as specified in [draft-ietf-httpbis-digest-headers-10](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-httpbis-digest-headers-10.html)), if any. It is not required to be sent for APIs that do not include a request payload (e.g. GET requests).
  * **Signature-Input**: This header indicates which headers and pseudo-headers are included, as well as the order in which they are used when calculating the signature. It is created as specified in [draft-ietf-httpbis-message-signatures-13](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-httpbis-message-signatures-13.html)
  * **Signature**: The value of the Signature header is created as described in [Section 3.1, Creating a Signature](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-httpbis-message-signatures-13.html#name-creating-a-signature), of IETF draft-ietf-httpbis-message-signatures-13. It uses the Private Key value generated by the [Key Management API](https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/developer/key-management/overview.html).
  * **x-ebay-signature-key**: This header includes the JWE that is created using the [Key Management API](https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/developer/key-management/overview.html)
* `signMessage` method to sign the incoming request object
* `validateSignature` method to validate the signature of the incoming request object
* There are individual methods as well to generate and validate the headers:
  * generateDigestHeader
  * generateSignature
  * generateSignatureInput
  * generateSignatureKey
  * validateDigestHeader
  * validateSignatureHeader

## Usage

**Prerequisites**

```
NodeJS: v12 or higher
NPM: v7 or higher
```

### Install

Using npm:

```shell
npm install digital-signature-nodejs-sdk
```

Using yarn:

```shell
yarn add digital-signature-nodejs-sdk
```

### Configure

In order to run the example application (signing-only) the [example-config.json](./examples/example-config.json) needs to be updated.

```json
{
  "digestAlgorithm": "<Algorithm used for generating content digest>",
  "jwe": "<JWE generated using Key Management API>",
  "privateKey": "<Private key generated using Key Management API>",
  "signatureComponents": "<Signature components for generating the base string>",
  "signatureParams": "<List of signature params>"
}

```

For both signing and signature validation, use [example-config-full.json](examples/example-config-full.json). 

```json
{
  "digestAlgorithm": "<Algorithm used for generating content digest>",
  "jweHeaderParams": "<The JWE header params>",
  "jwtExpiration": "<The JWT expiration in years>",
  "jwtPayload": "<The JWT  payload params>",
  "masterKey": "<The symmetric key used for JWE encryption and decryption>",
  "privateKey": "<Private key generated using Key Management API>",
  "publicKey": "<Public key generated using Key Management API>",
  "signatureComponents": "<Signature components for generating the base string>",
  "signatureParams": "<List of signature params>"
}

```


### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `digestAlgorithm` | string | The algorithm for generating the Content-Digest header. Supported vales are `sha256` and `sha512` |
| `jwe` | string | The JWE generated using the [Key Management API](https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/developer/key-management/overview.html)|
| `jweHeaderParams` | JSON object | The JWE header params. This is required only if a JWE is not provided in the config. |
| `jwtExpiration` | number | The JWT expiration in years. This is required only if a JWE is not provided in the config. |
| `jwtPayload` | JSON object | The JWT payload params. This is required only if a JWE is not provided in the config. |
| `masterKey` | string | The symmetric key. This is only needed for testing purposes. Ideally the JWE should be generated using the [Key Management API](https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/developer/key-management/overview.html) |
| `privateKey` | string | The privateKey generated using the [Key Management API](https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/developer/key-management/overview.html)  |
| `publicKey` | string | The publicKey generated using the [Key Management API](https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/developer/key-management/overview.html)  |
| `signatureComponents` | JSON object | The signature components that are a part of the `signatureParams`. These are used to generate the base string which is used to generate the signature header|
| `signatureParams` | Array | The list of headers that indicates which headers and pseudo-headers are included, as well as the order in which they are used when calculating the signature|

Note: You can refer to [example.js](examples/example.ts) for an example of how to setup an express server and use the SDK.

### Running the example

Using npm:

```shell
npm start
```

Using yarn:

```shell
yarn start
```

* Signing Configuration Sample (JWE is provided in the config): [example-config.json](examples/example-config.json).
* Full Configuration Sample (generates JWE): [example-config-full.json](examples/example-config-full.json).

### Note for Production deployment

```
For production, please host with HTTPS enabled.
```
